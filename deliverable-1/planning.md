## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What is the product?
A mobile application for understanding issues around global clean water supply. 
The partner is Engineers Without Borders (Water for the World - WT4W). This organization is concerned with educating the world about the global clean water supply and the disparities of access to it for different parts of the world.
The app is intended to educate people on the disparities of access to clean water through a series of questions along with an interactive module. The interactive module is a simple exercise where the user selects a country of the world, and depending on which country, is given a limited amount of in-app currency to create a virtual water filter whose parts have various costs. This simulation helps us understand both how a simple water filter is made, as well as the lack of resources some countries of the world face when required to build such systems. The limited instructions relate to literacy rate which in turn relates to general education levels in the population of the country.
The app helps new users understand the complicated process of setting up water filters by trying on the app first. A common use case for the app would be for students to use the app to learn about the unequal distribution of resources in the world. The app would also support educators as a teaching method while also assessing and providing information on student responses to the educator.

A prototype of the app can be found in the mockup.pdf in the same directory.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?
The primary target users are grade 7 - 11 students in different countries. The app aids in building a strong understanding of how water filters work and the ease or difficulty in accessing the raw materials required. While the app is specific to Canada, students will be assigned to different countries with varying literacy rates and monetary value to build the most efficient water filter possible. This will be a substitute for an in-person water filter building replicating the exact procedure and cost of materials. The app is also accessible to other people that might need it like first nations communities in Canada or even people in ghana. The main goal is to spread information about clean water and the ability to access it without extended periods of travel. This includes rural areas around the world where access to clean water is more of a luxury than a right leading to health problems for residents and children in the area.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?
The product is a hands-on experience that allows users to learn about the lack of clean water present in many areas of the world, predominantly in Africa. The product is efficient at teaching its users since it employs learning-by-doing, saving time and resources to relay the information. Moreover, the product has other features like quizzes that allows users to discover new information, which can potentially be adjusted by difficulty to allow more knowledgeable users to gain new information. The product includes links to updated and trustful resources that will provide users with accurate and up-to-date information regarding the topic. There are no other popular apps that employ a hands-on experience such as this product in relation to the problem the product is addressing. The product aligns with Water for the World’s objectives because the product helps bring knowledge in relation to water and sanitation to a wider array of people.

#### Q4: What are the user stories that make up the Minumum Viable Product (MVP)?
1. As a teacher/instructor, I want to provide essential assessment questions in increasing detail/difficulty and a feedback loop from pre-assessment to post-assessment to effectively raise the awareness of access to water to my students and test them well

3. As a teacher/instructor, I want to be able to test various related chapters like poverty, literacy, and accessibility issues using the application in order to give more well-rounded lessons to my students about water access
4. As a teacher/instructor, I want to be able to recreate the water filter building activity using geolocation capability in order to illustrate the different levels of poverty, literacy, accessibility, etc in different regions/countries
5. As a teacher/instructor, I want to be able to let students collaborate on the water filter-building activity and see each country’s budget in order to allow the students to work as a team, be aware of different countries’ economic backgrounds, and mimic real-world situations of countries uniting to help another country
6. As a student, I want to be able to try out creating different water filter models in order to better identify the important aspects of a good water filter
7. As a student, I want to be able to log into my own account in order to share my progress with my friends/teachers and also observe other people’s progress
8. As a student, I want to be able to easily use the application by following a simple workflow in order to ease my process of learning and track my own progress in understanding the issue of water access.

#### Q8: How will you work as a team?
Our group will meet online every Sunday at 10 am to discuss what we have done, and what we will complete by the next meeting. We also have a discord server that will be able to handle day-to-day communications when problems arise. 
We have already met with our partners once before D1, on the 19th. The meeting was around 70-80 minutes. We discussed the overall features of the app that we were to code, the purpose of the app, and the target audience. John, our partner, showed us mockups and an overall flow chart of how parts of the phone app are interconnected. We were able to get a good grasp of what we had to do and how it was supposed to look. Currently, we are planning to have an in-person meeting with John on Feb 4th to experience building a water filter. This will help us understand the app better, and will allow us to get to know each other as a team.

  
#### Q9: How will you organize your team?
We organize tasks using Github issues. We prioritize tasks by discussing their importance with the team and partner and determining their difficulty and length to rank tasks. We assign tasks by discussing them with the team and equally distributing them to be fair. We determine the status of work by testing our work so far via quality assurance.


#### Q10: What are the rules regarding how your team works?
**Communications:**
We expect to meet at least once every week within the team, and we will be holding the meeting through Zoom. We also scheduled a weekly meeting with our partner on Zoom and will utilize emails to communicate matters not discussed in the online meeting. 
 
**Collaboration: (Share your responses to Q8 & Q9 from A1)**
We have a Discord group where we communicate frequently. We hold each other accountable by making sure everyone responds in the group chat whenever there is a decision to be made, regardless of whether that is for meeting times or project-related issues. There is no one clear moderator as everyone is responsible for everyone. If a person doesn’t contribute or is not responsive, our first line of action will be to ask what problems he is currently facing. We will then decide as a team if the person should act more responsibly or if we should distribute some of his workloads with the rest of the team should that be needed.
