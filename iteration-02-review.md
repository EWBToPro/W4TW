## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 12, 2023
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.

1. Clear task delegations through agile methodology
 * Continuing from Assignment 2, we chose to stick with the division of our team into subteams and allowed each subteam to work on different aspects of our product separately. Before we embarked on our own code in our subteams, we held a whole team meeting where we agreed on the user stories that we wanted to handle and implement and clearly broke those user stories down into further subproblems and had each subteam take on a couple at a time. This collaborative decision granted us with clear objectives that did not seem too overwhelming as each subteam was able to see the whole product as smaller problems to solve and prevented us from performing double work. It allowed us to reap the benefits of the agile methodology.
2. Setting mini deadlines
 * Throughout the period where each subteam was implementing their parts of the product, we actively reminded each other of small deadlines to get certain tasks done. Once a deadline is reached, we would hold a very quick meeting just to update each other of the progress that has been made, the challenges faced, and the goal for the next deadline. One of the ways we kept track of all of these was using a group kanban board. The main benefit of these mini deadlines and using a kanban board was to ensure consistent progress within the team, but also to ensure team progress transparency and quick turnarounds. 
3. Sharing resources around the entire team
 * Due to our team’s colour background on a technical scale, each member’s competency and familiarity with different programs varies quite a bit. Despite this, we still had to collectively decide on the tech stack that we all would be willing to use throughout this project duration. In order to build each other’s knowledge and ability up, we shared online resources in our group chat to level out each other’s technical familiarity gap as best as we can. We felt that rather than leaving a member to learn and put into practice by himself, we could provide guidance to optimize each other’s learning growth. 

#### Q2. What did not work well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that did not work well.

1. Overestimation of our Minimum Viable Product goals
 * Like what Professor David has said about most projects, it is almost inevitable to figure out a team’s exact competency and capacity to build something. It is more frequent than not that a team’s final product becomes half of the team’s initial plan. We are no exception to that. Goals and objectives constantly vary throughout our project duration as we gradually learn to separate what is realistic and what is idealistic for our team.
2. Slight uneven project distribution at different stages of the product development
 * Although this is super hard to eliminate, even with an agile methodology, at times, we still struggle a little during these various times. One subteam could be operating at a higher rate than other subteams at a time and vice versa. However, we believe that embracing and adapting at these times are crucial as long as changes are made with our product’s big picture in mind. 


#### Q3(a). Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and/or how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

1. Place more emphasis on setting clearer lines between the Minimum Viable Product, our current team’s work efficiency rate and schedule, and our product goals going forward.
2. Be quicker in identifying problems and confronting them as soon as possible (eg: consulting our TA, our project partner John, or each other)

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps
Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you be combine the code from 3 sub-repos previously created) and if/how the assignment was helpful or not helpful.

We created a test branch from our main to push our separate code together and to test without worrying about the main branch. Before starting to code for D2, we also ensured clean and successful merging between our respective A2 code (at least for the backend and database).


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
 * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
