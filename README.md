Where and how are our tasks managed?
We organize tasks using Github issues. We prioritize tasks by discussing their importance with the team and partner and determining their difficulty and length to rank tasks. We assign tasks by discussing them with the team and equally distributing them to be fair. We determine the status of work by testing our work so far via quality assurance.
Q10: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

Communication: 
We expect to meet at least once every week within the team, and we will be holding the meeting through Zoom. We also scheduled a weekly meeting with our partner on Zoom and will utilize emails to communicate matters not discussed in the online meeting. 
Collaboration:
We have a Discord group where we communicate frequently. We hold each other accountable by making sure everyone responds in the group chat whenever there is a decision to be made, regardless of whether that is for meeting times or project-related issues. There is no one clear moderator as everyone is responsible for everyone. If a person doesnâ€™t contribute or is not responsive, our first line of action will be to ask what problems he is currently facing. We will then decide as a team if the person should act more responsibly or if we should distribute some of his workloads with the rest of the team should that be needed.
