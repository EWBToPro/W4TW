Where and how are our tasks managed?
We organize tasks using Github issues. We prioritize tasks by discussing their importance with the team and partner and determining their difficulty and length to rank tasks. We assign tasks by discussing them with the team and equally distributing them to be fair. We determine the status of work by testing our work so far via quality assurance.
