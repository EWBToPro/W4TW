# Git Good: Water Filter Building Application

## Description 
This is a mobile application for understanding issues around global clean water supply. The partner is Engineers Without Borders (Water for the World - WT4W). This organization is concerned with educating the world about the global clean water supply and the disparities of access to it for different parts of the world. The app is intended to educate people on the disparities of access to clean water through a series of questions along with an interactive module. A common use case for the app would be for students to use the app to learn about the unequal distribution of resources in the world. The app would also support educators as a teaching method while also assessing and providing information on student responses to the educator

## Key Features
1. Registering/logging into a student/teacher account
 * Due to the differing features of a student and a teacher (a student can answer questions, a teacher can create a homeroom, etc), the registration process for a student and a teacher differs. 
2. Completing a pre-game questionnaire on global water supply
 * Simple MCQ questions to test a student’s base knowledge on global water supply
3. Building an interactive water filter with varying countries’ resources and literacy rate
 * The interactive module is a simple exercise where the user selects a country of the world, and depending on which country, is given a limited amount of in-app currency to create a virtual water filter whose parts have various costs. 
* This simulation helps us understand both how a simple water filter is made, as well as the lack of resources some countries of the world face when required to build such systems. The limited instructions relate to literacy rate which in turn relates to general education levels in the population of the country.
4. Completing a post-game questionnaire on global water supply
* Short open-ended questions to test a student’s knowledge on global water supply after playing the game
5. Data storage via database cloud service railway
* User accounts including teachers and students, country information, game results are stored in a database cloud service called Railway
6. Emailing teacher result of most recent game
* Teachers will recieve a result of the most recent game via email automatically. An offline version of the app is available as well where this feature is turned off.

## Instructions
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully.
 
## Development requirements
 * What are the technical requirements for a developer to set up on their machine or server (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application. You should address this part like how one would expect a README doc of real-world deployed application would be.
 * You can see this [example](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup#readme) to get started.
 
## Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git/GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how?
 * Don't forget to **briefly justify why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase? And why?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
